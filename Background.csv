header,Background of LGBTQ+ Health,
text,,"“... Physicians should provide medical service with compassion and respect for human dignity for all people irrespective of their sexual orientation. Training physicians and psychiatrists in the assessment of sexuality is mandatory…We need to focus on people’s humanity rather than on their sexual orientation.” – Professor K.S. Jacob, Christian Medical College, Vellore, (The Hindu, July 26 2009)"
text,,"In order to support and affirm patients, healthcare providers must take initiative to understand LGBTQ+ issues. Engaging with this app is the first step to supporting LGBTQ+ patients, which is a natural extension of general patient support as a healthcare provider. "
text,,"Instances of homophobia and transphobia in India have often prevented the LGBTQ+ community from seeking and accessing essential health resources. Medical professionals can be implicitly or explicitly discriminatory, which can lead to healthcare barriers among India’s LGBTQ+ community. The lack of sensitive, culturally-competent care has culminated in significant disparities towards equitable health outcomes.  "
text,,"Gender and sexuality sensitive medical care can lead to open communication between medical personnel and patients, leading to more comprehensive health assessment and healthcare experiences. Below are terms that can facilitate better communication. "

header,Progressive Legal Rulings and Verdicts ,
text,,"There have been many rulings made by Indian judiciary bodies about the treatment of members of the LGBTQ+ community. Healthcare providers must be aware of these rulings because it will inform their understanding of LGBTQ+ life experiences. It is important to note that despite many legal victories, there is still pervasive disrimination and stigma against members of the LGBTQ+ community throughout Indian society."
text,,"It is currently illegal to discriminate against individuals based on sexual orientation. However, bias against LGBTQ+ communities is rampant. Here are legal developments that can inform medical practice:"
list,,"June 2009: Delhi High Court declared that discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal and unconstitutional. In a landmark judgment, a Delhi high court bench decides to strike down Section 377, saying it violates the fundamental rights to life, liberty, and equality as enshrined in the Indian constitution."
list,,"September 6, 2018: Section 377 of the Indian penal code outlawed any sex that goes ""against the order of nature,"" which was interpreted as a ban on all anal and oral sex, though it was generally used to prosecute men for having sex with other men. India struck down Section 377, decriminalizing homosexuality."
list,,"2019: Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) bill prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in various aspects of society, such as education, employment and the ability to rent or buy property. It also gives transgender persons a ""right to self-perceived identity"" — but requires them to register with the government if they want to be officially recognized as ""transgender."" If a transgender person wants to be legally recognized as such, they have to submit proof of gender confirmation surgery to the government. While such legislation may seem progressive, members of the LGBTQ+ community have fiercely criticized this bill because it incorrectly codifies and freezes the definition of “transgender” in law."
text,,"While these are positive developments, there still is widespread legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ communities."
header,Statements from Medical Organizations in Support of Indian LGBTQ+ Communities,
text,,"The Indian Psychiatric Society “recognizes same sex sexuality as a normal variant of human sexuality much like heterosexuality and bisexuality. There is no scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be altered by any treatment and that any such attempts may in fact lead to low self-esteem and stigmatization of the person.” – Position Statement by Indian Psychiatric Society, 2018"
text,,"“Based on existing scientific evidence and good practice guidelines from the field of psychiatry, Indian Psychiatric Society would like to state that there is no evidence to substantiate the belief that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease.” – Position Statement made by the President, Dr. T.V. Asokan, and General Secretary, Dr. N.N. Raju, of The Indian Psychiatric Society, 2014"
text,,"“Healthcare professionals encounter many aspects of human diversity when providing care, including different variations of human sexuality. A large body of scientific research asserts that homosexuality does not represent a disease, but rather a natural variation within the range of human sexuality without any intrinsically harmful health effects. The World Medical Association (WMA) condemns all forms of stigmatisation, criminalisation and discrimination of people based on their sexual orientation.” – World Medical Association (WMA) on Natural Variations of Human Sexuality, 2017"
text,,"“Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.” – World Health Organization, 2006"
